            I am a multidisciplinary designer focused on interaction, web, 3D,
            and user experience. I currently design products which help users
            manage and pay down their student debt at <Link
              name="Fidelity Investments"
              href="https://www.fidelity.com/"
            />
             .
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I believe that good design is scaffolded by sound collaboration,
            solid research, constant curiosity, and a holistic consideration for
            everyone and everything affected by it.

            Previously I obtained a master's degree (MGXD/MFA) in Graphic &
            Experience Design at <Link
              name="North Carolina State University"
              href="https://design.ncsu.edu/graphic-design/academics/masters/"
            />
             . During my time there, I worked as a designer/research assistant
            on Scale Worlds: a collaborative project between educators,
            designers, and engineers. Before that I worked as a graphic designer
            and frontend developer for a few different companies, spent 27
            months teaching in Tanzania as a Peace Corps Volunteer, and studied
            Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison.

            In my free time I enjoy distance running, making art, recording
            electronic and folk music, and exploring the great outdoors.
