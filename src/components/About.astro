          I am a multidisciplinary designer focused on interaction, web, 3D, and
          user experience. I currently design products which help users manage
          and pay down their student debt at <Link
            name="Fidelity Investments."

          I believe that good design is scaffolded by sound collaboration, solid
          research, constant curiosity, and a holistic consideration for
          everyone and everything affected by it.

          Previously I obtained a master's degree (MGXD/MFA) in Graphic &
          Experience Design at <Link
            name="North Carolina State University."
            href="https://design.ncsu.edu/graphic-design/academics/masters/"
          />
           During my time there, I worked as a designer/research assistant on
          Scale Worlds: a collaborative project between educators, designers,
          and engineers. Before that I worked as a graphic designer and frontend
          developer for a few different companies, spent 27 months teaching in
          Tanzania as a Peace Corps Volunteer, and studied Computer Science at
          the University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison.

          In my free time I enjoy distance running, making art, recording
          electronic and folk music, and exploring the great outdoors.

        It was built with <Link name="Astro JS" href="https://astro.build/" />
         and <Link name="Tailwind CSS." href="https://tailwindcss.com/" />
         It is also hosted <Link
