            I am a multidisciplinary designer focused on interaction, web, 3D,
            and user experience. I currently design products which help users
            manage and pay down their student debt at <Link
              name="Fidelity Investments."

            I am also an adjunct faculty member at <Link

            In May of 2023, I graduated with an MGXD (equivalent to an MFA) from

            <Link
              name="North Carolina State University."
              href="https://design.ncsu.edu/graphic-design/academics/masters/"
            />
            During my time there, I worked as a research assistant on
            <Link
              name="Scale Worlds."
              href="https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/vr/projects/#:~:text=SCALE%2DVR%20entails%20the%20design,be%20replicated%20in%20everyday%20experience"
            />
            Before that I worked as a graphic designer and frontend developer for
            a few different companies, spent 27 months teaching in Tanzania as a
            Peace Corps Volunteer, and studied Computer Science at the University
            of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

          <p>
            In my free time I enjoy distance running, making art, recording
            electronic and folk music, and exploring the great outdoors.

            This site is a portfolio and archive for my designs, art, and music.

            I built it with <Link name="Astro JS" href="https://astro.build/" />
            and <Link name="Tailwind CSS." href="https://tailwindcss.com/" />
            It is also hosted <Link

              href="https://github.com/BrianSekelsky/portfolio-2023"
            />. It is open source, meaning you are free to clone it and reuse
            any part of it.
