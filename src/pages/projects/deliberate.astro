            During the summer of 2022, I worked as a Product Designer for
            Deliberate AI, a mental health tech start-up. In this role, I worked
            to develop the design system for their flagship application which
            organizes and analyzes complex data that is relevant to mental
            health clinicians. Due to the start-up nature of the company, I had
            the opportunity to wear a number of hats. Along with UI and UX work,
            I also leveraged my visual design skills to produce a number of
            marketing materials including a product website.

            Coming into Deliberate, I had to learn a lot about the work of
            mental health clinicians. Research included reading online as well
            as speaking to in-house clinicians.

            Coming into the role, I encountered cluttered figma documents with
            inconsistent components, colors, and typography. I created a simple
            design system, with figma components, to tie together the brand
            identity and and user interface.

            After learning about clinicians' workflow as well as the
            capabilities of Deliberate's AI tech, we were able to define a
            variety of design features. An easily-scannable analysis and
            transcript of patient-clinician sessions.

            We developed a number of data visualization options for analyzing
            patients' progress using a variety of mental health questionnaire
            frameworks.

            Finally, I designed a client-focused product page which provides a
            broad overview of features available to three types of potential
            users: clinicians, supervisors, and clinic directors.
