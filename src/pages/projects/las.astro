        <p>
          Intelligence analysts have been tasked to provide indications and
          warnings of potential terrorist actions against US interests. Many of
          the terrorists have never been identified, and are scattered all
          around the globe. They are members of different but often linked
          organizations and can be called upon at any time to unleash acts of
          terrorism of many different sorts. Chloe is faced with lots of "dots"
          in the form of intelligence data that come from many different
          sources. Her first task is to decide which dots she should be trying
          to connect and then to make inferences about what these connections
          may mean. This is the basic step in generating hypotheses about what
          these connected "dots'' might mean.

          We interviewed several intelligence analysts throughout our process.
          This helped us better understand Chloe's process and how we could
          improve it. We mapped out our takeaways from these interviews.

            When the analyst gets to work in the morning and opens up their
            Atlas software, they see a summary of their day's work. All new
            reports are summarized by AI in a running text on the left side of
            the screen. Pre-highlighted words are paired with images and
            external documents arranged on the right. Emails, customer interests
            and tag filters are arranged at the bottom of the screen.
