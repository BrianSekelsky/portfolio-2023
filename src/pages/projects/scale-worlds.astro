            Scale Worlds is a virtual learning environment which enhances
            participants’ conception about size and scale. It has been funded
            through a National Science Foundation award titled
            <Link
              name="Virtual Reality to Improve Students’ Understanding of Scale in STEM."
              href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2055680"
            />

            For two years I worked under the guidance of

            <Link href="https://textimage.org/" name="Dr. Matthew Peterson" />
            and in close collaboration with professors and doctoral students from
            the Human Factors Engineering and STEM Education departments to design
            and develop this scale cognition learning environment. In this project,
            I have also acted as manager for three hourly design technicians.

            I was highly involved in this project, taking on diverse tasks
            including drafting design documents, planning out the user
            experience, coding in C#, 3D modeling in Blender, and developing in
            Unity. I have assisted in running two rounds of qualitative
            usability studies. Results from the first round have been published
            in a Human Factors journal. The majority of our design decisions
            have been made in response to the usability studies or are backed up
            by literature on the subject. Alejandra Magaña’s Framework for Size
            and Scale Cognition has been an invaluable resource during our
            design process.

            When I joined the project, the team of professors had secured funding
            through NSF partially due to a prototype created by Grace Wonaphotimuke.
