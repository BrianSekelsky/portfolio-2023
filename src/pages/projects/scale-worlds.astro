        <SmallHeading text="Background" />
        <p>
          Scale Worlds is a virtual learning environment that enhances students' understanding of size and scale—a critical concept in STEM education. The project was funded through a National Science Foundation award titled <Link name="Virtual Reality to Improve Students' Understanding of Scale in STEM." href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2055680" />
        </p>
        <p>
          For two years, I worked under the guidance of <Link href="https://textimage.org/" name="Dr. Matthew Peterson" /> and collaborated closely with professors and doctoral students from the Human Factors Engineering and STEM Education departments. My responsibilities included drafting design documents, planning user experiences, coding in C#, 3D modeling in Blender, developing in Unity, and managing three design technicians.

          Our design decisions were grounded in academic literature on scale cognition, particularly Alejandra Magaña's Framework for Size and Scale Cognition. This framework identifies the core concepts students need to grasp to understand scale effectively—from subatomic particles to cosmic structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Results from our first round of usability studies have been published in a Human Factors journal, validating our research-driven approach to educational design.

      <!-- Function Mapping -->
      <div class="col-span-1">
        <SmallHeading text="Function Mapping Methodology" />
        <p>
          To ensure a successful transition from VR to web, our team developed a novel design methodology we call function mapping. We authored a paper about this process, <Link href="https://dl.designresearchsociety.org/iasdr/iasdr2023/fullpapers/184/" name="Preserving theoretically-grounded functions across media platforms in interaction design," /> which I presented at IASDR 2023 in Milan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Function mapping identified the key concepts learners need to grasp for scale comprehension, drawn from Magaña's Framework for Scale Cognition and other academic literature. We created a chart mapping specific features to each learning concept, ensuring core objectives were preserved across VR and web versions while accounting for the different interface affordances.

        <p>
          With the function mapping table as my guide, I sketched interface ideas on paper and in Figma. Since key features were already identified in the mapping process, it was easier to conceptualize and iterate on solutions. The function mapping provided a clear framework for translating the VR experience while preserving essential learning objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I implemented the designs as a working prototype using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js to power the 3D experience in the browser.
