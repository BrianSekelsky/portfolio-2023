      title="Imagine Public Transportation"
      objective="This project features a series of provocative billboard mockups designed to spark public discourse on the complex issues surrounding car ownership and urban planning in the United States. Each billboard tackles aspects like the environmental impact of excessive car usage, the social and economic implications of car-dependent urban design, and the need for sustainable, inclusive mobility solutions. Inspired by urban signage principles and train windows, these visuals strategically intervene in the urban fabric to challenge ingrained car-centric norms, raise awareness on prioritizing public spaces, and encourage citizens to reimagine how our cities are structured and experienced."

        <p>
          A publishing class I took in grad school forced me to reconsider what
          makes something a publication. During one project, I explored how a
          public medium might "reach across the aisle" and create discussion
          around urban planning in the United States. I designed a series of
          billboards with a slightly sarcastic tone.
