      objective="I spend my time at Fidelity working on complex B2B and B2C problems related to student debt. I was brought onto the Student Debt Direct product to work on modernization efforts. Tasked with the ambiguous goal of improving the overall user experience for the post-enrollment side, I worked with the team to implement a new design system, fix accessibility issues, and simplify the loan management experience."

        <p>
          44 million Americans have student debt. Student Debt Direct is a workplace benefit that employers can offer to their employees through Fidelity. It is primarily a retention and hiring incentive where the
          employer agrees to pay some amount of their employee's student debt
          every month.
        </p>
        <p>
          The product requires complicated loan
          verification and management with cumbersome loan service provider
          systems. Any hope of automating the verification process has been squashed under the current presidential administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first things I did after being brought onto this project
          was to learn the existing product front-to-back. I worked with the
          systems analyst to create a miro that maps the entire lifecycle of the
          product.

        <p>
          Next, I partnered with our user experience researcher to run a
          heuristic study. I even coded the frontend for a
          reference user interface we would use in this study.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hosted two two-hour meetings where we took turns interacting with
          the reference user interface while going through specific scenarios a
          user would go through in the lifecycle. Then we wrote sticky notes on
          Miro, talking about things we liked and didn't like, things that
          seemed to give us problems. We also spoke to a few users from within
          Fidelity who use this product, asking questions and gaining insights
          from them.

          After identifying pain points, I continued discussing with product
          owners, analysts, developers, and more. Maintaining formal meetings
          twice a week, I facilitated discussions meant to excavate ideas from
          all stakeholders involved in this project. By showing off problems
          with the current product and showing very rough, low-fidelity designs
          for ideas, everyone involved was able to have a sense of ownership and
          come forward with ideas.

        <p class="lg:w-1/2">
          One of the most significant solutions we encountered and built was to
          separate the complicated loan management procedure into two separate
          flows. We can determine if the user needs to edit a loan and give them
          one experience. If the problem is more complicated and they need to
          add a new loan, we can give them a different experience. Additionally,
          allowing users to add additional loans and see a historical record of
          their accounts develops trust and ease of swapping in the loan they
          most want to be paid off first.

          In the final iterations of the desin, we have introduced inline alerts that tell the user when there are problems with their loan. The alerts help users understand what about their current loan is problematic and how they can go about fixing their issue and getting back to recieving payments.
