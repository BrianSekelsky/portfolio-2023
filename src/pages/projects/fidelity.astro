      objective="I spend my time at Fidelity working on complex B2B problems related to student debt. One project that I led the design of, end to end, was for our administrative software. This internal tool is used by operations employees to maintain all of our users’ accounts and loans across our three products. The project also included some important updates to the customer facing products to simplify processes, reconcile with changes to the databases, and update to the new design system."

        <p>
          Fidelity’s internal operations team needs an easy way to process the
          loans and accounts of the many users who participate in our products.
          Our operations team is also growing as our user base grows, so we need
          a streamlined way for operations employees to jump in and start
          managing loan data quickly. As a secondary goal, we wanted to update
          administrative software to use the up-to-date components.

          As part of this modernization effort I have also redesigned the
          frontend for some customer facing products. This is the homepage for
          our workplace benefit in which employers help pay off their employees'
          student debt.
